        "body": "Actor Ryan Reynolds may be onto something.\n\nReynolds, who is filming \"Deadpool\" in his hometown of Vancouver, was the victim of an alleged hit and run in the city earlier this month. When a CBC reporter asked how he was doing, this is how he responded: \n\nPut Beachcombers back on the air and I'll call. https://t.co/g9jbBppMHu\u2014 Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) April 12, 2015\n\n\nInspired by Reynolds, we've come up with a list of Canadian shows we'd love to see rebooted. \n\nHere are 21 Canadian TV shows that are overdue for a comeback:\n\n\"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\"\n\n\n\nAn occasionally frightening series about a group of teens who told scary stories by campfire, like \"The Tale of the Ghastly Grinner.\" Guest stars included Ryan Gosling, Neve Campbell and Tia and Tamera Mowry.\n\nWhy it should come back: Because it was PG-rated horror that still managed to scare the wits out of young Canadians of the 1990s. \n\n\"Road to Avonlea\"\n\n\t\n\nSarah Polley starred as Sara Stanley, a 10-year-old city girl sent to live with her family in Avonlea, P.E.I., where she is raised by her aunts Hetty (Jackie Burroughs) and Olivia (Mag Ruffman).\n\nWhy it should come back: Because Sunday nights on CBC have never been the same since it went off the air in 1997.\n\n\"Breaker High\"\n\n\n\nThis high school aboard a cruise ship introduced a young Ryan Gosling to the hearts of countless Canadian teens.\n\nWhy it should come back: We'd love to see how these kids try to maintain cell service on the high seas. \n\n\"Edgemont\"\n\n\n\nKristin Kreuk and Dominic Zamprogna anchored this series about teens coping with issues such as racism, homosexuality and social isolation at a high school outside Vancouver. \n\nWhy it should come back: The original cast would have finished college and be well into their careers by now. We'd love to see how they managed the real world. Also, \"Degrassi's\" reboot worked wonders for CTV.\n\n\"Street Cents\"\n\n\n\nThis teen show starring a pre-\"Jonovision\" Jonathan Torrens provided cautionary tales for young consumers on how to buy responsibly.\n\nWhy it should come back: Companies still want teens' money. Let's keep them informed.\n\n\"Street Legal\"\n\n\n\n\"Street Legal\" related the trials of aggressive lawyers at Toronto law firm Barr, Robinovitch and Tchobanian. Carrie Barr (Sonja Smits) and Leon Robinovitch (Eric Peterson) were activist types, but the show became better known for aggressive pros Olivia Novak (Cynthia Dale) and Chuck Tchobanian (C. David Johnson).\n\nWhy it should come back: Canada has seen no lack of legal action for some high-profile citizens, from Conrad Black to Michael Bryant and Rob Ford. We'd love to see how these cases could inspire fiction.\n\n\"Danger Bay\"\n\n\n\nThe Vancouver Aquarium was rarely more exciting than on this show, in which veterinarian Grant \"Doc\" Roberts (Donnelly Rhodes) and his children Nicole (Ocean Hellman) and Jonah (Christopher Crabb) fought to protect the environment along the West Coast.\n\nWhy it should come back: B.C. faces the prospect of two major oil pipelines bringing product to the coast. Time for \"Danger Bay\" 2.0. \n\n\"The Littlest Hobo\"\n\n\n\nThis German shepherd wandered from town to town, helping to lift people out of trouble. We all wanted a Littlest Hobo in our lives.\n\nWhy it should come back: It was a lovely, timeless, innocent show that gave us joy. And we get nostalgic whenever we hear \"Maybe Tomorrow.\"\n\n\"North of 60\"\n\n\n\n\"North of 60\" put a spotlight on life for northern communities. Tina Keeper played RCMP Cpl. Michelle Kenidi, a policewoman struggling to keep the community of Lynx River, N.W.T. (and her own demons) under control.\n\nWhy it should come back: Canada's a big, diverse country, and our TV shows should reflect that.  \n\n\"Wok with Yan\"\n\n\n\nTV chef Stephen Yan was quick with a delicious meal and even faster with his zingers. Also, those aprons! A new pun on \"wok\" with every episode.\n\nWhy it should come back: Because it's high time that the Internet truly discovered \"Wok with Yan.\"\n\n\"Traders\"\n\n\n\nA Global TV drama about ambitious traders at a Toronto investment firm that struggles to compete in the international marketplace.\n\nWhy it should come back: In this economy, there'd be no shortage of dramatic storylines. \n\n\"The Newsroom\"\n\n\t\n\nA biting satire about crusty, selfish TV producer George Findlay (Ken Finkleman) running a news show at a public broadcaster (ostensibly CBC).\n\nWhy it should come back: We'd all like to forget Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" and remember this one.\n\n\"Due South\"\n\n\n\nConst. Benton Fraser (Paul Gross) was a Canadian Mountie who was assigned to work in Chicago as he tried to solve his father's murder. An upstanding police officer, his morals and methods often clashed with his partner, Chicago cop Ray Vecchio.\n\nWhy it should come back: The world needs a few more good cops like Const. Fraser. \n\n\"E.N.G.\"\n\n\n\nAnother newsroom drama about a television station where staff including producer Sara Botsford (Anne Hildebrandt) and news director Mike Fennell (Art Hindle) struggled to keep up ratings.\n\nWhy it should come back: Rebrand it as \"D.N.G.\" (Digital News Gathering), set it in a modern newsroom and you set yourself up for some great commentary on the state of the media.\n\n\"Front Page Challenge\"\n\n\n\nThis game show, which ran on CBC for almost four decades, featured a panel of journalists who had to guess a news story associated with an anonymous guest. Its high-profile guests included Malcolm X, Gordie Howe and Indira Gandhi.\n\nWhy it should come back: We need more Canadian game shows. Period.\n\n\"Speakers' Corner\"\n\n\n\nCityTV gave Canadians a chance to vent their feelings thanks to the \"Speakers' Corner\" booth \u2014 it was also the place where the Barenaked Ladies launched their career.\n\nWhy it should come back: It was social media before social media existed, and we're nostalgic for the days before Facebook. \n\n\"You Can't Do That On Television\"\n\n\n\nKids felt a little naughty for watching \"You Can't Do That On Television,\" an irreverent sketch comedy series where you'd be slimed for admitting you don't know something. Or drenched anytime you asked for water. It was weird. \n\nWhy it should come back: Canadian TV is missing the edge it used to have. And Barth.\n\n\"Catwalk\"\n\n\n\nIt only lasted from 1992-1994, but this series about a young band made a strong impression with its appealing leads, dark visuals and catchy electronic music.\n\nWhy it should come back: We'd love to see Catwalk try to make it in the age of downloading.\n\n\"Student Bodies\"\n\n\n\nA teen comedy about good-looking students working at a high school newspaper. Cartoon vignettes helped to illustrate their daily travails.\n\nWhy it should come back: Now that \"Student Bodies\" star Ross Hull has graduated to real-life journalism, what would he teach the kids at his fictional alma mater? \n\n\"Kidstreet\"\n\n\n\nAn outrageously fun kids show where sibling contestants were tested as to how much they knew about each other.\n\nWhy it should come back: Because Generation Y ought to have a chance to play with the treasure trove of toys they kept at the side of the stage.\n\nAnd last but not least...\n \n\"The Beachcombers\"\n\n\n\nA simple premise spawned a television series that is now the longest running TV drama in Canadian history. This one, taking place in Gibsons, B.C., told of lumber salvager Nick Adonidas (Bruno Gerussi) trying to keep his competitor Relic (Robert Clothier) from hurting his business.\n\nWhy it should come back: Because Ryan Reynolds said so.\n\n Like Us On Facebook  Follow Us On Twitter\n\nALSO ON HUFFPOST:\n\n -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

        "body": "Whitney C. Harris for WomensHealth.comIt's not exactly easy to scratch an itch down there, which is why it's so frustrating when it happens (and sometimes it's like it comes completely out of nowhere, right?). Vaginal itching can be caused by something as simple as your period products\u2014but in other cases, it can actually be a symptom of a more serious issue. This guide will help you figure out exactly what's making you feel like you have ants in your pants\u2014and what your treatment options are. (That being said, when it comes to your lady parts, it's always best to play it safe and visit your gyno for a proper diagnosis.)\n\nBacterial vaginosis\nBacterial vaginosis (a.k.a. BV) is the most common reason for vaginal itching and is caused by an imbalance in healthy bacteria and a change in vaginal pH. It feels similar to a yeast infection, but in this case, the discharge is more watery and usually has an odor, explains Lauren Streicher, MD, author of Sex Rx: Hormones, Health, and Your Best Sex Ever. When it comes to treatment, Streicher says RepHresh, an OTC cream, often works. If your BV doesn't clear up after the suggested usage time, you'll have to ask your doc for something prescription-strength.\n\nMORE: 7 Things That Make Your Vagina Sad\n\nYeast infection\nLike BV, a yeast infection is frequently the result of vaginal pH being out of whack, says Wendy Askew, MD, a board-certified ob-gyn at the Institute for Women's Health in San Antonio. They can occur at random or following antibiotic use, sex, stress, or a change in diet (and women with diabetes have a higher risk). In addition to itchiness, you may also notice curdled, white, or thick discharge. The good news is that you can go ahead and use an OTC remedy, like Monistat, which should take care of the symptoms within a day or so. To avoid recurrent infections, Askew recommends taking a probiotic with a high bacteria count of acidophilus, like Flora-Q, which will help keep yeast in check.\n\nContact dermatitis\nThis skin irritation is caused by allergies to certain products, says Brett Worly, MD, assistant professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Ohio State University. You can get it from anything with perfumes or additives, including condoms and lubricants, and on top of itching, you may also notice redness, swelling, and skin thickening. It can also be the result of shaving, says Askew. If you know that you're susceptible to vaginal irritation, use hypoallergenic hygiene products, like shampoo, fabric softeners, and laundry detergents, making sure to avoid chemicals, soaps, and irritating lubricants, says Worly. Even toilet paper with scents or colors can be troublemakers. Plus, you should definitely avoid shaving if you're sensitive\u2014and never, ever douche. The vagina is self-cleaning, so you don't need to put anything on or in it, says Streiche\n\nEczema or Psoriasis\nGenetic skin disorders like these two can cause redness and itching in the genital region, along with a patchy or rash-like appearance. If you're diagnosed with either, a mild steroid like hydrocortisone and taking oatmeal baths can help alleviate the discomfort, says Askew. If you don't feel relief within a week, ask your doctor about other treatment options.\n\nMORE: 12 Ways to Show Your Vagina More Love Every Day\n\nSexually transmitted diseases\nWe shouldn't have to tell you this again, but unprotected sex can lead to an STD (which is why you always, always need to use protection). And a bunch of them can make your lady parts itch, including chlamydia, herpes, trichomoniasis, and gonorrhea. Crabs, or pubic lice, can also appear in women with hair down there. With any of these, the itching (or tingling sensation) can progress to pain and burning, says Askew. If you experience itching along with any other common STD symptoms like burning while you pee, foul-smelling discharge, sores on your genitals, and pain during sex, you should book it to your gyno to get tested ASAP. If you do test positive for an STD, your doctor will give you either injectable or oral antibiotics, or an antiviral medication in the case of herpes, says Askew.\n\nLichen sclerosus\nThis serious condition and cause of vulvar itching appears as white spots on the skin, says Streicher. While it can come out of nowhere, some medical professionals think hormones or an overactive immune system may have something to do with it. Lichen sclerosus needs to be diagnosed by a gynecologist and treated with prescription medication.\n\nHormones\nAnytime your hormone\u00a0levels change or fluctuate (like during your period, pregnancy, menopause, or while you're taking birth control), you may experience vaginal itching. Dryness is another indicator that hormones could be to to blame for your pain. When it comes to your period, the products you use during that time of the month (like pads and panty liners) often contain fragrances or colors that can add to the discomfort. If this happens to you often, consider trying a menstrual cup or organic cotton products, which may be less irritating. However, it may be difficult to pinpoint if your birth control prescription is what's causing you to itch down there (sometimes the only way to know if this is the culprit is to stop or start hormonal contraception, says Worly). With any of these hormonal changes, your doctor might prescribe a hormonal cream to apply topically and you can also ask about switching pills if the itch continues to be a persistent problem.\n\nThe article 7 Common Reasons Your Vagina Is Itchy Beyond Belief\u00a0originally ran on WomensHealth.com.\n\nMORE:\u00a06 Reasons Your Butt Is Red And Itchy",
